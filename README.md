### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Karthik, a software engineer with a passion for building scalable applications and exploring new technologies. I will be graduating in May '25 with a Masters degree in Computer Science from UMass Amherst. I interned at Juniper Networks in the Summer of '24 as a Software Engineer, and I had a 2 year stint as a Quant at Goldman Sachs India previously.
